# <b>Service Level Agreement (SLA) for MiniTwit API</b>

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between the provider of the MiniTwit API and third-party developers who are using the MiniTwit API for their own frontend implementations. The purpose of this SLA is to outline the service guarantees we provide for our MiniTwit API.

 <b>1. Service Availability </b> <br/>
We guarantee that the MiniTwit API will be available 99.9% of the time during a calendar month. Service availability is calculated by dividing the total uptime by the total possible uptime (in minutes) during the month, excluding scheduled maintenance periods.

<b>2. Scheduled Maintenance </b><br/>
We will notify you at least 48 hours in advance of any scheduled maintenance that may impact the availability of the MiniTwit API. Scheduled maintenance will not exceed 4 hours per month, and we will make every effort to schedule it during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions.

<b>3. Response Time </b><br/>
We guarantee that the MiniTwit API will have an average response time of less than 500 milliseconds for 95% of API requests in a calendar month.

<b>4. Support </b><br/>
We will provide email and ticket-based support for the MiniTwit API.

<b>5. Security </b><br/>
We commit to using industry-standard security measures to protect your data and API access, including encryption, firewalls, and access controls. We will also regularly perform security audits and promptly address any identified vulnerabilities.

<b>6. Data Backup</b> <br/>
We will perform daily backups of your data and retain them for a minimum of 30 days.

<b>7. Limitations</b> <br/>
This SLA does not cover issues caused by factors outside of our control, such as natural disasters, third-party service outages, or your own network connectivity issues. It also does not cover issues arising from your misuse of the MiniTwit API, such as exceeding rate limits or violating our terms of service.

<b>8. Amendments </b><br/>
We reserve the right to amend this SLA at any time. We will provide at least 30 days' notice of any changes by email or through our website.
