## 1) Refactor ITU-MiniTwit to another language and technology of your choice.
### Language choice
Our motivation for choosing a language was primarily learning something new, and/or improving on it, with respect to what we would likely use in the future, during employment in a company. 

We landed on using Java with the Spring framework. Spring provides a web framework that makes it easy to map the functionality from the original python MiniTwit, and it also provides easy integration with Docker for later containerization. It is also VERY commonly used in enterprise applications worldwide and specifically in Denmark, from our own job experience. Therefore using it while practicing DevOps will provide us with skills we will likely need in the future. 

We did not consider benchmarking different frameworks and picking whatever is fastest, since it doesn't align with our motivations for picking the language (or taking the course for that matter). 

### Functionality mapping
We started our refactoring by mapping all the functionality from the original python MiniTwit into a document, that we could as a checklist for our new applications.
