This project contains the application we will be working on during the DevOps course. It is a small twitter-like application, written in Java with the Spring framework. 

In the [worklogs](https://github.com/Magmose/ITU2023-DevOps/tree/dev/worklogs) directory we will keep small logs of the work that we do, one for each session. They will contain information about the changes that are made to the application, along with answers to questions in the tasks for each week, and motivations for choices that we make.
